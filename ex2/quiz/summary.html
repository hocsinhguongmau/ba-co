		<h1><center>Responsive Web Design</center></h1>
		<p>
			In modern days, as technologies are increasing rapidly, portable
			devices such as mobile phone and ipad have become more popular.
			People tend to use them for daily tasks more often that created the
			demand for web development on these devices. At first, they
			separated one website into different versions for better web
			browsing experience on different equipments. However, this method
			seemed to be costly and inconvenient, therefore, Responsive Web
			Design (RWD) was born. Instead of having a fixed design for one
			specific device, we can have one optimal viewing experience which is
			not only more flexible, but more adaptive to the media that renders
			them. After W3C created media queries, we are able to target
			specific devices and the physical characteristics of the device
			rendering our work. Furthermore, it is not limited to layout
			changes, media queries allow us to enhance our website for better
			visuals and user experience.

			In this article, I understand the importance of RWD, how it affects
			web development and how to implement it. In my opinion, the most
			crucial part in this article is media queries. With its help, we can
			easily make our websites responsive based on device widths. For
			example, if we need to write or load css for desktop only, we can
			use min-device-width greater than 1024px, since most ipad landscape
			resolution stays at 1024px. Similarly, we can use max-device-width
			equals or less than 480px to make a hamburger navigation that only
			displays on mobile devices, which is extremely powerful, in my
			opinion.

			This article gave me a lot of advantages since my major is to be a
			front end developer. It is a good practice to save time and money
			for making a website. The development process may take longer at
			first, but later it will be much more faster since we do not need to
			have different versions for different devices. In addition, the
			maintenance part will become easier, imagine we have to test and fix
			three different places just for one issue. With those benefits, I
			think RWD is a good approach that needs to be considered in a web
			development process.
